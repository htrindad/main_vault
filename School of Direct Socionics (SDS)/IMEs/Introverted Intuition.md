Also known as "White intuition", "Time", "T", "Temporal intuition", "relational intuition", "Ni"

## Description by Hugo Parada

Introverted intuition is the awareness of processes happening in an objects through time, and takes the external status of the object as an output, while the internal status as an input and process. Time is the sole focus of this element. People who have this element in a mental function are keenly aware of temporal phenomena, historical tendencies, how what happened to an object in the past, will in the future, as well as vice-versa. Introverted Intuition, is also not just about pace and time, but about pacing, how fast and how slow is something, how quickly and slow are they mobilizing. As an [[dynamic_static|dynamic]] element, it takes a body in motion as a parameter for it's object of focus (as we see for), and as a [[introverted_extroverted|introverted]] element, it requires to observe the relation of a body towards something else, instead of the object itself.

On the contrary to popular belief on this element, it's not about underlying meaning of the perception, as it is an introverted element, it does not look for objective/bodily consistency of what it's focusing on, but instead something that connects to it. In the case of ![[Ni.png|20]] it looks about how the object state **will be influenced in relation through time** or **its time dependencies**, like how quick or retarded it is behaving.
