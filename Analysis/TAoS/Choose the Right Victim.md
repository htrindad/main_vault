> Everything depends on the target of your seduction. Study your prey thoroughly, and choose only those who will prove susceptible to your charms. The right victims are those for whom you can fill a void, who see in you something exotic. They are often isolated or at least somewhat unhappy (perhaps because of recent adverse circumstances), or can easily be made so—for the completely contented person is almost impossible to seduce. The perfect victim has some natural quality that attracts you. The strong emotions this quality inspires will help make your seductive maneuvers seem more natural and dynamic. The perfect victim allows for the perfect chase.

## Unity

You shouldn't seduce everyone. Only those who are either open to your charms, or that have already seduced you in one way or another (ideally, both these cases should be true to a degree if not fully). Do not take into consideration their lexical responses, but look into their unconscious drives. That person also fills you in some way, and vice-versa.
