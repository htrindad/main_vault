> Everyone loves a compliment
> — Abraham Lincoln

## Unity

Most people are persuaded by reward, and appreciation, rather than condemnation. Lack of appreciation make people go insane.

## Parts

- How people get attached to symbols of hierarchy
- How children and criminals will do the most anti-social stuff for the sake of ego
- How ego is the main driving forces of people
- How lack of admiration makes people insane and create scenarios where they are admired/respect
- How people ignore giving compliments
- How self-esteem breeds ambition
- There is always something to appreciate on someone else, because there is something that they are superior to you
